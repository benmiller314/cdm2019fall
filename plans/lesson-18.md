# Web Unit Studio

**Work to have done**:
* As much of the [Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)](http://web.archive.org/web/20190213013947/https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) tutorial as you can â€“ at least parts 1-6 (from "Introduction" through "CSS Selectors")

**Plan for the day**:

1. Web Design in 4 minutes (in 15 minutes)
2. Composing Strategy:
   - decide on your content sections
   - decide what's nested, what's at the same level
   - draw boxes, and label them
   - use the boxes to write HTML containers
   - use the labels to give them CSS classes
   - only then start to style the classes
3. Go forth!
4. Exit note
